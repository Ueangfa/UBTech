# Hi there! 👋
My name is Ueangfa “Nui” Buachum, and I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor of Applied Science in Cybersecurity at St. Petersburg College, graduating in July 2026. I’m passionate about learning technical skills that help secure systems, protect data, and understand how real-world threats work.
I have hands-on experience with MySQL, Python, Linux, Windows Server, Splunk, Rapid7 InsightIDR, Wireshark, and Snort. I also completed an Information Security Internship at SPC Clearwater, where I investigated alerts, supported incident response, and worked closely with the IT security team to strengthen our security posture.
I enjoy building projects that help me grow as a cybersecurity professional, especially in areas like network defense, threat detection, SOC operations, and secure system administration. SQL Learning Lab is part of my journey to improve my database and analysis skills as I prepare for future cybersecurity roles.
