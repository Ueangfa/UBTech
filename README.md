# Hi there! 👋
My name is **Ueangfa “Nui” Buachum**, and I’m currently pursuing my **Bachelor of Applied Science in Cybersecurity at St. Petersburg College**, graduating in **July 2026**. I’m passionate about learning technical skills that help secure systems, protect data, and understand how real-world threats work.
I have hands-on experience with **MySQL, Python, Linux, Windows Server, Splunk, Rapid7 InsightIDR, Wireshark, and Snort**. I also completed an **Information Security Internship at SPC Clearwater**, where I investigated alerts, supported incident response, and worked closely with the IT security team to strengthen our security posture.
I enjoy building projects that help me grow as a cybersecurity professional, especially in areas like **network defense, threat detection, SOC operations, and secure system administration**. SQL Learning Lab is part of my journey to improve my database and analysis skills as I prepare for future cybersecurity roles.
